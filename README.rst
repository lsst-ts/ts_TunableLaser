TunableLaser
============

This is the readme for the TunableLaser component.

Installation
------------

The following assumptions are made here.

* Operating system is Centos 7
* ts_sal is setup according to SAL User guide.
* Python 3.6 virtualenv
* The understanding that this is still under development and is pre-release hence the requirements-dev.txt

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt -e .
    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:~/gitrepo/ts_salobj/python
    source ~/gitrepo/ts_sal/setup.env #unless this line is already in your ~/.bashrc or whereever you put this line script
